Hi! I am Md Nasre Alam, a PhD candidate in the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://chemical.iitd.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), India. I have completed my pre-PhD synopsis and submitted my thesis. I have worked under Prof. [Hariprasad Kodamana](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~kodamana/index.html) and Prof. [Anurag S. Rathore](https://www.biotechcmz.com/), on my PhD thesis focusing on Machine Learning-Driven Modelling and Optimization of Biopharmaceutical Processes. My Ph.D. work focuses the AI/ML integrated frameworks development including deep learning based convolutional neural networks, hybrid modelling employing physics‚Äêinformed neural networks, symbolic machine learning, and multi-agent reinforcenment learning using mechanistic modelling with different multiobjective optimization approaches to improve the efficiency and productivity in end-to-end bioprocessing, particularly for biopharmaceutical production.

Earlier, during my M.Tech, I also gained valuable research experience through an academic research internship at the [University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg](https://www.wits.ac.za/), where I worked on water optimizatin network for industrial applications under Prof. [Thokozani Majozi](https://www.wits.ac.za/about-wits/office-of-the-vice-chancellor/faculty-deans/thokozani-majozi/). I was also selected under the Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC) program as part of which I worked in collaboration with the [Laboratory for Intelligent Applications in Chemical Engineering](https://home.iitm.ac.in/raj/) and [Human-in-the-Loop Cyber-Physical Systems Group](https://home.iitm.ac.in/babji.srinivasan/index.html) at IIT Madras under Prof. [Babji Srinivasan](https://home.iitm.ac.in/babji.srinivasan/index.html) and Prof. [Rajagopalan Srinivasan](https://home.iitm.ac.in/raj/index.html).
