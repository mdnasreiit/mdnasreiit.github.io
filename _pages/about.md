Hi! I am Md. Nasre Alam, a PhD candidate in the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://chemical.iitd.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), India. Having completed my synopsis presentation, I anticipate submitting my thesis and graduating within the next few months. I am working with Prof. [Hariprasad Kodamana](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~kodamana/index.html) and Prof. [Anurag S. Rathore](https://www.biotechcmz.com/), focusing on machine learning applications in biopharmaceutical process engineering. My Ph.D. thesis titled â€œMachine Learning-Driven Modelling and Optimization of Biopharmaceutical Processes discusses the implementation of advanced deep learning techniques and multiobjective optimization approaches to improve the efficiency and productivity of downstream bioprocessing, particularly for biopharmaceutical production. 

Earlier, during my M.Tech, I also gained valuable research experience during an academic internship at the [University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg](https://www.wits.ac.za/), where I worked on water network optimization for industrial applications. I was also selected under the Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC) program as part of which I worked in collaboration with the [Laboratory for Intelligent Applications in Chemical Engineering](https://home.iitm.ac.in/raj/) at IIT Madras.

For a detailed overview of my academic, research, and internship journey, please refer to my curriculum vitae [cv link can be added here].
