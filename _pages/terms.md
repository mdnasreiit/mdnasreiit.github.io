I have been working/have worked on the following broad areas of work, focusing on applications in healthcare and route planning for aircraft.

## 1. Healthcare operation and delivery modeling

### a. Organ Allocation Simulation
This work involved employing simulation modeling, queuing theory, and machine learning algorithms to predict real-time delays in the kidney transplantation system. <br>

**Related works:** <span style="color:blue">1 and 5b</span>, as referenced on the published manuscript page.

### b. Patient Diversion Across Healthcare Facility Networks
The approach utilised stochastic modeling (discrete event simulation), analytical queuing theory, and simulation-driven machine learning (Sim-ML) techniques to allocate healthcare facilities to patients, minimising the time required to receive care.  <br>

**Related works:** <span style="color:blue">2b, 2c, 4d, 4e</span>, and others, as referenced on the published manuscript page.

### c. Statistical Analysis of Healthcare-Seeking Behaviour and Stakeholders’ Perceptions of Referral Mechanisms
This work focused on using statistical learning techniques, including regression analyses and hypothesis testing, to analyse patients’ and healthcare providers’ choices regarding various aspects of healthcare. <br>

**Related works:** <span style="color:blue">2a, 2d, and 2e</span>, as referenced on the published manuscript page.

## 2. Dynamic route planning of combat aircraft
This research involved applying network optimization algorithms such as A* and Dijkstra's algorithm to determine minimum-cost routes while avoiding threats and radar emplacements.  <br>

**Related works:** <span style="color:blue">3a and 4</span>, as referenced on the published manuscript page.
