I am working/have worked on the following broad categories of work application towards healthcare and dynamic route planning of aircrafts.


## Organ Allocation Simulation

The approach here involved using discrete event simulation, queueing theory, and machine learning algorithms for real-time delay prediction in the kidney transplantation system.

### Patient diversion across healthcare facility networksReal-time healthcare facikity 

The approach here involved using stochastic modeling (discrete event simulation), analytical queueing theoretic and simulation-driven machine learning (Sim-ML) technqiues for allocating healthcare facilities to patients where care could be recievd in the minimumtime.

### Statistical analysis of healthcare seeking behavior and stakeholders perception towards referral mechanisms

The approach here involved using statistical learning techniques (regression analyses), hypotheitical testing, etc. to statistcially analyse the patients and healthcare providers choices towards different asoects of healthcare.

#### Dynamic route planning

The approach here involved using network optimization algorithms such as A-star, Dijkstra's algorithm to estabkish minimum cost routes by avoding threats and radar emplacements
