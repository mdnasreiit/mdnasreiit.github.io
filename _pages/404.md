I am working/have worked on the following broad categories of work application towards biopharmaceutical manufacturing and upstream and downstream processes. 


## Monoclonal antibody products...

The approach here involved developing a deep learning-aided multi-objective optimization of a downstream process for production of monoclonal antibody products.
